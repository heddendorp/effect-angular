# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately instead of opening
a public issue.

- Email: security@effect-angular.dev
- Include: affected package, reproduction details, impact, and suggested fix (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and provide a status update
after triage.

## Disclosure Process

- We validate and triage the report.
- We prepare and test a fix.
- We coordinate responsible disclosure and release notes.
