# Spec: Add OSS project scaffolding + Knope release flow

## Overview
Add foundational open-source project scaffolding and automation, including a root README, a Knope-based release flow aligned with the Knope GitHub Bot workflow (change files in PRs; release PRs generated by the bot), Dependabot configuration, and core community/health files.

## Functional Requirements
1. Root README
   - High-level project overview and goals
   - Quickstart/setup instructions aligned with current tooling (Bun, Angular workspace)
   - Pointers to key packages/libraries in this repo
2. Release automation
   - Knope configuration aligned with the Knope GitHub Bot workflow
   - Change files in PRs as the release input mechanism
   - GitHub Actions workflow(s) to support the bot-driven release PR flow
3. Dependabot
   - Automated dependency update configuration for the repository
4. Community/health files
   - LICENSE (MIT)
   - CODE_OF_CONDUCT
   - CONTRIBUTING
   - SECURITY

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Works with GitHub Actions
- Non-interactive CI execution
- Minimal additional tooling beyond Knope
- Clear, maintainable documentation
- Consistent with existing repo conventions

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new root `README.md` exists and includes overview + quickstart + package references
- Knope is configured for a change-file-driven, bot-based release workflow
- GitHub Actions workflows are present and aligned with the Knope bot flow
- Dependabot configuration is present and valid
- LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, and SECURITY files are present
- License is MIT

## Out of Scope
- Additional governance/funding files (e.g., GOVERNANCE, MAINTAINERS, FUNDING)
- Issue/PR templates
- Large documentation site or multi-page docs
